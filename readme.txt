This is a visualization of Stack overflow data done in the Adaptive Web course at ASU. Please note that the original data is not used.  
Execute the 'preprocess.py' using python 2.7. You need numpy, scipy, pandas, nltk packages and nltk stopwords corpus.  
The python file creates three files, 'wordCount.csv', 'wordcountsperuser.csv' and 'cosine_sim' (these are already provided).   Open index.html in a browser.
